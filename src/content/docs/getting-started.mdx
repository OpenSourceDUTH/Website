description: Welcome to the OpenSourceDUTH API documentation.
---

<Callout icon="⚠️" type="warning">
The API is currently in alpha (v0), which will be deprecated as soon as v1 is released. 
Integrating with our API is not recommended for production use at this time as it will probably undergo breaking changes to the endpoints and return schemas.
</Callout>

This is the API documentation for all of our team's work. 
We use a central API to manage our open-source projects in order to enable seemless integration and allow for users to easily access data across our platforms.

In order to prevent the abuse of our API and server resources, we require all users to authenticate and obtain an API key*. **The entire API is free to use and we will never charge for access.**
Public data (meaning data that is not personally identifiable and we have permission to share or have collected ourselves) 
can be exported in bulk using the appropriate endpoints, in case you want to avoid making multiple requests or need local copes for your apps.

*`(Ratelimits apply on a per feature/endpoint basis. Academic accounts get higher usage quotas. Rate limits can be increased by contacting us.)`
