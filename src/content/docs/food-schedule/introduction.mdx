description: OpenSourceDUTH Food Schedule API Documentation
---
This section of the API documentation provides information about the Food Schedule endpoints. It has been organized into the following structure depending on the integration level
you wish to achieve. 

Generally, the <span><FolderFile type="folder">examples</FolderFile></span> folder contains practical examples on how to call each endpoint
in `cURL`, `JavaScript` and `Python` and is probably the best place to start. <FolderFile type="folder">Guides</FolderFile> contains small tutorials on with complete example
programs that may utilize multiple endpoints. The <FolderFile type="folder">reference</FolderFile> folder contains the complete reference documentation for each endpoint which is more
technical and explains all available parameters and response formats. Finally, the <FolderFile type="file">release-notes</FolderFile> file contains 
information about the changes and updates made to the Food Schedule API over time.
