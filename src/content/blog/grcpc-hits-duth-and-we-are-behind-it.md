## Introduction
The Greek Regional Collegiate Programming Contest (GRCPC) is part of the International Colligiate Programmming Contest (ICPC) by ACM and is a multi-tiered competitive programming competition among the universities of the world where more than 60.000 students participate from over 3.000 universities[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) in order to solve programming problems of varying difficuly.

GRCPC, however, isn't just about speed or syntax - It's about using critical thinking, creativity and collaboration to solve problems effeciently under pressure enabling students gorw their skills.  

## Our Role in GRCPC
This year, OpenSourceDUTH along with the support from our university will proudly take on a co-hosting role at GRCPC, contributing to the organizing of the event. As a student operated team focused on open source technologies and learning through collaboration our involvement in GRCPC is a natural extension of those goals. Simply put, we want to empower students through code and our community.

Helping organize an event like GRCPC is something that requires more than just enthusiasm, it requires collaborating on multiple levels with both our university and other amazing students from accross Greece. 

Our contributions included: 
- The reservation and setup of the infrastructure required for the event
- Putting the custom Ubuntu-Based OSes in the computers that the students will use during the event
- Updating the [official GRCPC website](https://grcpc.upatras.gr) to include the latest information about the event and it's members as well as some minor design updates that improve both it's UX and UI
- Ensuring that the testing site in Kavala will operate smoothly to ensure the optimal experience for the student participants
