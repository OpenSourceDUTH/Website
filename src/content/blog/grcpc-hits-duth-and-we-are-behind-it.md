## Introduction
The Greek Regional Collegiate Programming Contest (GRCPC) is part of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), a multi-tiered competitive programming competition where more than 60,000 students from over 3,000 universities[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) participate to solve problems of varying difficulty.

GRCPC, however, isn't just about speed or syntax - It's about using critical thinking, creativity and collaboration to solve problems effeciently under pressure enabling students gorw their skills.  

## Our Role in GRCPC
This year, OpenSourceDUTH, along with support from our university, will proudly take on a co-hosting role at GRCPC, contributing to the organization of the event. As a student-operated team focused on open-source technologies and learning through collaboration, our involvement in GRCPC is a natural extension of those goals. We want to empower students through code and community.

Helping organize an event like GRCPC requires more than enthusiasm, it requires collaboration at multiple levels with both our university and all the amazing students on the GRCPC team across Greece. 

Our contributions include: 
- Reserving and setting up the infrastructure required for the event
- Installing the custom Ubuntu-based OS images on the competition machines
- Ensuring the integrity and security of the competition at our testing site
- Updating the [official GRCPC website](https://grcpc.upatras.gr) with the latest information about the event and its members, plus minor design updates to improve UX/UI
- Ensuring that the testing site in Kavala operates smoothly to provide the best experience for participants

## What to expect
Whether you're a seasoned problem solver who grinds Codeforces/LeetCode daily or a curious first-year student eager to challenge yourself, GRCPC 2025 promises an unforgettable experience packed with tough problems, good energy, and collaboration.

At OpenSourceDUTH we are constantly living through late-night bug hunts and caffeine-fueled problem solving sessions to build software that we want to use - and now, we want to share that thrilling feeling of figuring out some of the hardest problems with you @ GRCPC 2025 in our campus! Here's what's waiting for you once you light up those monitors:

#### Teams of Three \<\\> One Machine

You’ll code with two teammates of your choice against teams from universities across Greece and Cyprus. Practice communication, coordination, and time management.

#### No Internet \<\\> No Shortcurs

Once the contest begins it will just be your team, your code, some documentation and up to 30 page (printed) notes per team member. No AI, no stack overflow, no Google. Solve ~8 prolems using Python OR Java OR C/C++ OR Kotlin in 5 hours and let the best team win!

## Moving Forward

#### How to Qualify

In order to qualify for the next phase of GRCPC there is only one requirement: Be the best team in your university! Simply put, do your best and we'll do the rest... There is also a secret system that allows universities to send more than one team, this means that the best you do overall the more likely it is that our university will send more than one team and increase your chances to qualify to the next round as well!

#### What happens at SEERC

If you got to the next stage congratulations! Now you can compete once more in the Southern Eastern contest and be one of the top 13 teams that qualify for the european championship. At this point you have proved that your team is one of the best in your country and in Europe while growing and meeting an ever increasing community of talented developers of the future. 

After the European Championship you may participate in the world finals and see how you rank amongst top students of the world.


## Why it matters
We could give you the facts about GRCPC all day but we havent really told you why you should care to join, or why we are so excited about this event. On the surface GRCPC is about solving real world algorithmic challenges under pressure, building teamwork, communication and time-management skills, but in reallity GRCPC allows you to connect with a community that loves to learn, build and share... 

Too many of us wait to "learn first" before attempting to solve anything and we tend to avoid things that we feel we can not solve. Events like GRCPC teach you by doing and help you discover different ways of approaching issues by connecting with differnt people... maybe it's something you didn't think, or an idea you brushed away too cuickly. Problems rarely require complete mastery of a programming language and you can solve most problems with some basic commands and creative thinking, THAT is the goal of GRCPC - Problem solve together and see how far you can go. 

We at OpenSourceDUTH are particularly excited about this event because it embodies so many of the things we stand for: open collaboration, hands-on learning and pushing technical boundries. In a world where AI tools are changing how we learn, code and work, GRCPC reminds us that true innovation actually comes from human ingenuity especially when working under constraints. 

Participating in GRCPC can help you in ways you might not expect:

#### Growth

You will learn how to embrace failure as part of the process and hone soft skills that can't be covered by text books. You will also sharpen your problem solving skills and be better prepeard to shine in interviews and real world projects, optimize code and build effecient apps. 

#### Community

You will connect with like-minded students from across Greece and Cyprus, potentially sparking life-long friendships, open source contributions and even start-up ideas. OpenSourceDUTH itself was actually brought to life at an event like GRCPC and we can't wait to see what *you* bring to life beyond the contest.

#### Broader Impact

Participating in GRCPC helps raise the profile of competitive programming in Greece and Cyprus, inspiring more students to pursue careers in technology and software engineering. By joining, you contribute to a culture of innovation and problem solving that extends beyond the contest itself—impacting future hackathons, open source projects, and tech communities. Your involvement encourages universities to invest in technical education and helps build a stronger, more connected ecosystem for aspiring programmers in our region.
